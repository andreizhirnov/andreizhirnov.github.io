I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Exeter. I am a quantitative political scientist by training and work in the areas of comparative political institutions and the comparative studies of electoral systems.
I study such phenomena as

* institutional and non-institutional determinants of electoral behaviour
* electoral coordation
* organisational stability of political parties
* party system institutionalisation
* interplay between formal and informal institutions
* the integrating role of parties in federations
* populism

I am a member of the project titled ["Populism's Roots: Economic and Cultural Explanations in Democracies of Europe (PRECEDE)"](https://precede.eu/) and contribute to the work of [the COVID-19 Policy Respose Lab](https://www.binghamton.edu/political-science/covid-response/index.html).
